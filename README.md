A responsive grid
====

## How to use?
Add class "grid" to your wrapper element and "grid__cell" to elements that you want to act as grid cells. Then to define number of columns for different resolutions add classes in format grid--[resolution]_[columnCount] (for example grid--768_3) to .grid wrapper. Supported breakpoints are 320, 480, 768, 1024, and 1280 and columns count can be between 2 and 6. Feel free to update css or sass file to support other breakpoints and column counts.
